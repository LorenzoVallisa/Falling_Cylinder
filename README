------------ FREE FALLING CYLINDER SIMULATION USING OVERSET METHOD -------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This test-case is able to reproduce the dynamic of a solid object (cylinder) falling first through air, impacting through water 
all the way on the bottom of the cuboid domain. Numerical Method used is OVERSET

- Download this repository into a RUN folder of OpenFOAM run path version v2012


- For domain features please see BACKGROUND folder
